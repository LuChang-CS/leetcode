# LeetCode Solutions

This folder contains the solutions for LeetCode, including pdf version and tex version.

## Note
- If you want to build tex version on your computer, I recommend you to install `MikTeX` and `TexStudio` (Command line user could ignore this please). And you must first install `Python` 2.6 or later and a Python package `Pygments` to support `minted`.
- To build this solution, run the following command:
```bash
xelatex.exe -synctex=1 -interaction=nonstopmode -shell-escape solutions.tex
```
