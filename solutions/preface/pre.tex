\chapter{Preface}
\label{ch:preface}
This project is aimed to accompany my girlfriend \href{https://github.com/mengjiaozhang}{@MengjiaoZhang} to learn git, programming skills and algorithms.

Here, I want to thank \href{https://leetcode.com/}{LeetCode} providing these problems. It will be better if all problems can be accessed without subscribing.
